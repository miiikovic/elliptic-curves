# Elliptic Curves

This project implements basic operations on elliptic curves for use in elliptic curve cryptography.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/miiikovic/elliptic-curves.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd eliptic-curves
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

    tsc
    ```

5. Run the application:

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```


## What it Does

This project provides a basic implementation of elliptic curve operations, including point addition and doubling. The `Point` class represents points on the elliptic curve, and the code demonstrates how to perform point addition, doubling, and scalar multiplication.
